llvm backend implementation for a riscv variant cpu.  Current code only contains add/mul/Jump/Call operations. 
It can be built and tested with a few simple commands but you need first familiar with llvm build process.

This github property only contains part of llvm 19.1.3 with patch for riscv variant cpu code  since my limited network access.
I will submit complete code very soon.
